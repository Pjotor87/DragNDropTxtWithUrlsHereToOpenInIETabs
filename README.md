# DragNDropTxtWithUrlsHereToOpenInIETabs
This is a tool that opens many sites in IE as tabs in one browser window.
I've used this alot in various SharePoint projects where a bunch of sites need to be bulk edited in the browser.
Great for putting out fires!

Build this in visual studio and grab the .exe file from the bin\Release folder

How to use
----------
1. Make sure IE is your default browser.
2. Create one or more txt files where each line contains a url.
3. Drag-n-drop the files on the .exe file.
